<%# form_for is a Rails helper method that accepts an ActiveRecord object as
    the first argument.
    if @question is not persisted in the database, form_for makes the `action`
    of the form go to `questions_path` (Rails convention) and it will make the
    `method` of `form` be POST
    %>

<%# this file `_form.html.erb` is considered to be a partial which means you
    can include it in any other template (such as new.html.erb and edit.html.erb)
    you must start the partial name with '_'. Partials have access to the same
    instance variables available in the templates (e.g. @question) %>

<%# If you give the `form_for` helper an ActiveRecord object that is persisted
    then the generated form will have an action that submits to
     `question_path(@question)` wherer @question is the ActiveRecord object that
     you passed to the form. The action will be PATCH (using the _method wordaround) %>

<%= simple_form_for @question do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title, input_html: {class: "abc"}, label_html: {class: "hey"} %>
  <%= f.input :body %>
  <%= f.association :category %>
  <%= f.association :tags, as: :check_boxes, input_html: {class: "chosen-select"} %>
  <%= f.submit class: "btn btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
